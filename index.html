    <h1>Subversion Controlling: Just Drag &amp; Drop</h1>
      <p>Bitters helps designers start projects faster by de*fining a basic set of Sass variables,* default element style and project structure. It’s been specifically designed for use within web applications. Bitters should live in your project’s root Sass directory and we encourage you to modify and extend it to meet your design and brand requirements.</p>
      <p>Bitters is made to work alongside a CSS reset; not replace one. Our suggested reset is Normalize.</p>
      <p>I have friends who say they have a very broad taste in music. They listen to “everything.” From Jimmy Buffet to Metallica, they love every kind of music there is. Many <em>programmers</em> are the same way. They’ve only ever known the procedural and object oriented paradigms. They think BASIC and Java are as different as languages can get. When they encounter a new language, their first question is “what’s the syntax?” Their question should be “how does it think about problems?”</p>
      <p>These warnings can come in several forms - don't use this specific library, stay away from this tool, this programming language is slow, this a <code>return</code> pattern is for architecture astronauts, the entire paradigm of [current popular thing] is fundamentally flawed.</p>

        <p>I’m saying that a taxonomy that groups together Swift and Haskell because they have map is no more useful than grouping Wangga, Opera, and Rock together because they have vocalists.</p>
